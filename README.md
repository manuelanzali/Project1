## About our Analysis

● The intention of this was to explore whether certain factors affect the amount of time spent or productive time lost on social media. As well as analyze the distribution of time 
spent on the social media platforms. 


## VISUALIZATIONS

## Conclusion

Our initial interest in this topic was motivated by public opinion that social media affects other factors in an individual’s life, however we saw that there is no clear effect seen by debt status, gender, profession or age when it comes to the use of social media. 

Further analysis could be done to look at whether cultural factors influence social media use globally. Based off our exploration, there does not seem to be one single factor that influences social media usage.


## Limitations

● Measure of time - We don't know if the data collected was measured in seconds, minutes, or hours. But looking at the data, we determined it is cumulative over a period of time (days, weeks, months, years). We are still able to use the trends discovered within this data to solidify or conclusion.
● We are missing satisfaction level data for age group age 0-21 in certain countries
● We only have data for 10 countries around the world
